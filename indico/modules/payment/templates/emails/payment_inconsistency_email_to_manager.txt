Dear manager of the event {{ event.getTitle() }},

It appears that the payment of the registrant with ID {{ registrant.getId() }} has an incorrect
amount of money (received {{ format_currency(amount, currency, locale='en_GB') }} while expecting {{ format_currency(registrant.getTotal(), currency, locale='en_GB') }}.
Please, check with the registrant to see if there was some misunderstanding.

Regards.
