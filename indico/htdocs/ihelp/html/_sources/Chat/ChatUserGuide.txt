What is XMPP/Jabber?
--------------------

XMPP (formerly known as Jabber) is an instant messaging system that
allows users to communicate with one another. XMPP also
supports creating and joining chat rooms for group communication.


-------------------
Recommended clients
-------------------

We recommend using our installation of the web client Jappix: http://jabber.cern.ch.
On the other hand, if you prefer to use your own local client, we recommend:

- Pidgin for Linux/Windows
- Adium for Mac OS

However, there are many other options, so feel free to check some other clients to choose the one you prefer.

See more in the chapter about `XMPP Clients <XMPPClients.html>`_.
