Paper Reviewing Management
--------------------------

Setup the Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to choose the type of
paper reviewing for your conference:

* *No reviewing*: no use of the reviewing module

* *Content reviewing*: paper's content will be checked only by the content reviewers

* *Layout reviewing*: paper's layout will be checked only by the layout reviewers

* *Content and layout reviewing*: both of the previous points

        |image7|

-------------------------

The second step is setting up the options depending on the type of
reviewing you have chosen:

Options for Content reviewing mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


- There are three statuses by default. You can add your own 
  statuses that will be proposed to the Content Reviewers, when they have to 
  give opinions about the paper's content, and to the Referee when he has to give a judgement.

        |image8|

- As well, there is a way to add also reviewing questions in order to help 
  Content Reviewers and Referees giving their judgements for 
  the paper's content. The Referee will be able to see the Content 
  Reviewers' answers and this will help him with the final judgement.

        |image9|

------------------------

Options for Layout reviewing mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can add questions in order to help Layout Reviewers to give 
  their judgments. These questions are visible when they 
  have to judge the paper. This will guide them to follow the 
  layout criteria given by you (see figure as example).

        |image10|

----------------------

Options for Content and Layout reviewing mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can set up all the options in previous two sections - 1.3.1.1 / 1.3.1.2.

- You can set due dates for the Reviewing Team to give their 
  judgments. They will not be able to judge the papers after the 
  deadline. This default dates apply only used for a new contribution.

        |image11|

- The system sends automatic e-mails in order to notify the Reviewing 
  Team or the authors of the papers in several situations. You can enable 
  or disable the e-mails by clicking on the check boxes.

        |image12|

- The Paper reviewing module allows you to upload your 
  own layout template which the authors can download and use. This will 
  help them to follow the required layout criteria you impose. The template 
  can be in form of document file.

Assign Team
~~~~~~~~~~~

Assign Managers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Managers of the Paper Reviewing will be responsible for the
reviewing part of the conference. Their responsibility will be to
designate Referees, Layout and Content Reviewers who will be
responsible for papers reviewing and editing. The Reviewing Manager
will be able to set up the options for the Reviewing Module, to
specify the team's competences and to assign contributions to the
Referees and Reviewers. You can add Paper Review Manager after 
accessing the ``Team`` tab. 

        |image16|
    
 From the ``Assign Managers of the Paper Reviewing Module`` area,
 click on the button ``Add Existing`` to search for the user.

------------------------

Assign Reviewers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create list of Referees, Layout Reviewers and Content
Reviewers.

When you add a user to be Referee, you are giving him the
rights to assign contributions to the Layout and Content Reviewers.
Also, the Referee has to give the final judgment for the
contribution - ``to be corrected``, ``accepted`` or ``rejected``. If the
contribution status is given to be corrected then the Referee will
be able to correct it by himself if it's needed.

The Layout Reviewer has to judge the editing part of the contributions.
He will be able to access only the contributions that are assigned
to him to judge. When we set up the Layout Reviewing mode, he will have to give
the final judgement of the contribution. If needed the Layout
Reviewer can correct the papers by himself.

The Content Reviewers have to give their opinion of contribution's
content. They will have access only to the contributions that are
assigned to them.

 Depending on the chosen reviewing mode you need to assign different
 team of reviewers (see section 2.1.3.1). 
 
        |image21| 

 When you click ``Assign``, a dialog will show up. 
 Use the dialog popup to select the reviewer you wish to assign. 
 If there are defined competences for him, they will be shown close to his name.

 If the paper revieiwng mode is "Content reviewing" or "Content and Layout Reviewing", the Referees
 you choose will be the responsibles for assigning Layout and Content Reviewers to this 
 contribution. The Referee has also to give the final judgment for the contribution 
 - ``to be corrected``, ``accepted`` or ``rejected`` and to correct it by himself if needed.
 
 If you have chosen "Layout Reviewing" the Layout Reviewer should give the final judgement for
 the contributions.
