   By clicking on the name you can access the specific information for the contribution.
        
How to submit the material for the contribution 
-----------------------------------------------
 
 * The next step will be to submit your material. You can do this by clicking on the contribution name. 
   Use ``Add Material`` link, next to ``Reviewing materials``. Here you must add the material to be reviewed.
   Only the material added in this section will be judged by the reviewing team.

 * Choose the file(s) for your contribution. You may add a description and convert your file to PDF format. 
   After that click on ``Upload``.

  * You can send your added material for reviewing only by clicking on the ``Send`` button. 
    By doing this you will "lock" your material until the end of the reviewing process.
    You cannot add or remove material any more, unless you have made
    a mistake while sending. In this case, use the ``UNDO sending`` button.
    Now you see the ``Reviewing status`` of your contribution.

  * The reviewing process ends when the final judgement for your contribution is ``Accepted`` or ``Rejected``.

  * The reviewing process will continue if the final judgement for your contribution is ``To be corrected``.    
    You will have to send the material again, after correction. Then the reviewing process will start again.
    You can see the ``Reviewing history`` after clicking on the ``Show history`` link.
