 When you access the Layout Reviewers Area you will find a list of all the contributions
 that are assigned to you for judgment. You also see the state for every contribution.

 First you should fill in the questions provided by the Paper Review Manager, after this, 
 you can give your judgement for the layout of the contribution: ``to be corrected``, ``rejected``, 
 ``accepted``. The comments that you will write down should help the Referee to give his judgment. 
 The authors of the contribution will receive an automatic e-mail notification containing your comments
 and judgment, if the Managers of the Paper Reviewing set this option.
