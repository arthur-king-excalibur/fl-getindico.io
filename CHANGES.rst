--------------

*Released on November 10, 2017*

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Hide category field in event creation dialog if there are no
  subcategories (:issue:`3112`)
- Remove length limit from registration form field captions (:issue:`3119`)

  values (such as multi-select registration form fields) to CSV or
  Excel (:issue:`3060`)
- Use custom site title in page title (:issue:`3018`)
- Allow manually entering dates in datetime fields (:issue:`3136`)

  an error if the mail server is temporarily unavailable. Sending an
  email is also retried for a while in case of failure. In case of a
  persistent failure the email is dumped to the temp directory and
  can be re-sent manually using the new ``indico resend_email``
  command (:issue:`3121`)
- Reject requests containing NUL bytes in the query string (:issue:`3142`)

  thanks :user:`nop33`)
