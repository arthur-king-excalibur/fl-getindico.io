What is XMPP/Jabber?
====================

XMPP (formerly known as Jabber) is an instant messaging system that
allows CERN users to communicate with one another. XMPP also
supports creating and joining chat rooms for group communication.

Recommended clients
===================

For Linux/Windows users we recommend Pidgin. If you are using Mac OS,
our choice is Adium. However, there are many other options, so feel
free to check some other clients to choose the one you prefer.
Also, in case you don't want to use a desktop client you can use
our webclient, Jappix, which can be accesed in the URL
