Paper Reviewing Module - Referee's Guide
========================================

Getting started
---------------

 As a referee, your responsibilities are to assign contributions to the reviewers and to give the 
 final judgement for all of the contributions you have been assigned to. You may log in the system 
 and you will find in the left menu two links under ``My Conference``, ``Assign Contributions`` and 
 ``Referee Area``.

Assigning Contributions to the Reviewers
----------------------------------------

 You can assign more than one contribution to the same Reviewers by selecting them using the check boxes. 
 Depending on the chosen reviewing mode (``Content reviewing`` or ``Content and layout reviewing``) you need to 
 assign different kinds of reviewers.

 After checking the checkboxes and clicking the ``Assign`` button, a dialog will be displaied. 
 Use the popup dialog to select the reviewer you wish to assign to the selected contributions. 
 If there are pre-defined competences for him, they will be shown close to his name.

 Also, you can click on the name of a contribution and assign a reviewing team for it.

 When you access the Referee Area you will find a list of all the contributions that are assign 
 to you for judgment. You can follow
 
  * if the author of the contribution has submitted the mateials for reviewing
  * the state for every contribution, if it is judged by the Content Reviewers or by the Layout Reviewer, 
    or by both.

 Your responsibility as Referee will be to give the **final judgment** for the contribution: ``to be corrected``, 
 ``rejected``, ``accepted`` or one of the customized statues added by the Managers. Accessing again the reviewing 
 area (by clicking on the contribution's title) you will be able to see the judgments and the opinions of 
 the layout and the content given by the reviewing team.
 
 In order to submit your final judgment click on ``Send`` button. The authors of the contribution will receive 
 automatically generated e-mail notification containing your comments and judgment, if the Managers of the 
 Paper Reviewing set this option.

 The material which is subject of reviewing is accessible for the Referees from the ``Material to Review`` tab.
 
        |image8|
        
 The system gives you the opportunity to follow the reviewing history for every contribution. 
 The reviewing history is built when there are more than one reviews per paper. You can access 
 it just right after you send your final judgment from the ``History`` tab.
