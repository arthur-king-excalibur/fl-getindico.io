~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step to start using the module is to choose the type of
paper reviewing for your conference:

* *No reviewing*: no use of the reviewing module

* *Content reviewing*: paper's content will be checked by the content reviewers

* *Layout reviewing*: paper's layout will be checked by the layout reviewers

* *Content and layout reviewing*: both of the previous points

The second step is setting up the options depending on the type of
reviewing you have chosen:

Options for Content reviewing mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


- There are three statuses given by default by the system.You can add your own 
  statuses that will be also proposed to the Content Reviewers when they have to 
  give opinions of the paper's content; the Referee when he has to give a judgement.

        |image8|

- There is a way to add also reviewing questions in order to help 
  Content Reviewers and Referees giving their judgments for 
  the paper's content. The Referee will be able to see the Content 
  Reviewers' answers and this will help him with the final judgment.

------------------------

Options for Layout reviewing mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can add questions in order to help Layout Reviewers to give 
  their judgments. These questions are visible for them when they 
  have to judge the paper. This will guide them to follow the 
  layout criteria given by you.

Assign Managers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Managers of the Paper Reviewing will be responsible for the
reviewing part of the conference. Their responsibility will be to
designate Referees, Layout and Content Reviewers who will be

Assign Reviewers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create list of Referees, Layout Reviewers and Content
Reviewers.

As you are adding a user to be Referee, you are giving him the
rights to assign contributions to the Layout and Content Reviewers.
Also, the Referee has to give the final judgment for the
contribution - ``to be corrected``, ``accepted`` or ``rejected``. If the
contribution status is given to be corrected then the Referee will
be able to correct it by himself if it's needed.

The Layout Reviewer has to judge the editing of the contributions.
He will be able to access only the contributions that are assigned
to him to judge. For Layout Reviewing mode, he will have to give
the final judgement of the contribution. If needed the Layout
Reviewer can correct the papers by himself.

The Content Reviewers have to give their opinion of contribution's
content. They will have access only to the contributions that are
assigned to them.
