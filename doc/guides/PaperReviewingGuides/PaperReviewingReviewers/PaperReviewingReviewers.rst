Content Reviewer Area
--------------------
        
 When you access the Content Reviewers Area you will find a list of all the contributions that are assign
 to you for judgment. You can see the state for every contribution - if you already judged a contribution
 or if the assigned referee has given the final judgement.

 First you should fill in the approved requirements given by the Paper Review Manager. 
 The comments that you will write down should help the Referee to give his judgment.
 Then give your judgment for the layout of the contribution: ``to be corrected``, ``rejected``, ``accepted``. 
 If the Managers of the Paper Reviewing set this option - the authors of the contribution will receive 
 automatically generated e-mail notification containing your comments and judgment.
