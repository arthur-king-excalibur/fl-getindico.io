 As a layout reviewer your responsibility is to judge the layout of all of the contributions
 you are assigned to. You may log in the system and you will find a link in the left menu under

 When you access the Layout Reviewers Area you will find a list of all the contributions that are assign
 to you for judgment. You can see the state for every contribution.

 First you should fill in the approved requirements given by the Paper Review Manager. Then give 
 your judgment for the layout of the contribution: ``to be corrected``, ``rejected``, ``accepted``. 
 The comments that you will write down should help the Referee to give his judgment. If the Managers
 of the Paper Reviewing set this option - the authors of the contribution will receive automatically
 generated e-mail notification containing your comments and judgment.
