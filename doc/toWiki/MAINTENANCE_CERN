Indico at CERN maintenance guide
================================

0. Purpose of this document

This document aims at describing the details of the Indico installation at CERN.
You won't find any information about how to install the system or any 
explanation of the different parts of it, you'll only find the details about the
concrete configuration at CERN and some instructions for keeping up running.


1. Overview of the Indico system at CERN

Nowadays, there is one machine which is dedicated for production at CERN: 
"pcdh94.cern.ch" which is aliased as "indico.cern.ch". This machine contains
the whole system including the DB and App servers. Please find in the following
sections details about each component of the system and its concrete 
configuration.


2. DB server 

As it has been said the DB server is installed and running on the machine 
"indico.cern.ch". 
At CERN, ZEO is begin used in order to communicate with ZODB 
so a ZEO server must be running all the time. The configuration of the ZEO 
sever is kept in a separated config file which is in /data04/zeo/etc/zeo.cfg.
Some details about the ZEO configuration:
    * connection: using TCP socket at address "cdsdoc.cern.ch" port "9675"
    * db storage: using FileStorage at "/data04/zodb-data/makac/data.fs"
    * log file: at "/data04/zeo/log/zeo.log"

In order to start/stop the ZEO server and ensure it is always running, Zope 
zdaemon is used. The configuration of the zdctl is kept in a separted 
configuration file at "/data04/zeo/etc/zdctl.cfg". This file contains the
details about how to launch the ZEO server. With the current configuration
zdctl will launch the ZEO server using zdrun which makes sure that the server is
always running and if it dies it restarts it automatically. 
In order to control ZEO server zdctl must always be used; here there are some 
commands:

    * Start DB server: /soft/bin/python2.3 /soft/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages/zdaemon/zdctl.py -C /data04/zeo/etc/zdctl.cfg start
    * Stop DB server: /soft/bin/python2.3 /soft/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages/zdaemon/zdctl.py -C /data04/zeo/etc/zdctl.cfg stop

However, a special script exists for making things easier: 
    
    * Start DB server: /soft/bin/indico_ctl start
    * Stop DB server: /soft/bin/indico_ctl stop

Right now the DB server is running under user "hsanchez" so if you are not 
logged as "hsanchez" you need to execute it with root privileges.


3. Archive repository

The archive repository is also on the "indico.cern.ch" machine. The archive 
repository is under "/data04/MaKaC/archive". This file space must be owned and 
writable for www-data group.


4. Application server

4.1. Indico package

The Indico package is installed in the standard python "site-packages" library:
"/soft/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages/MaKaC". Which means that the Indico
configuration file is in "/soft/python/lib/python2.3/site-packages/MaKaC/common/MaKaCConfig.py". Any change in the configuration requires a restarting of the 
HTTP server (see section 4.2).
Only root has the right for modifying/updating MaKaC and any update of the 
Indico package should be done only with FULLY TESTED releases. No modification 
of the code should be done in the production machine directly; instead, the CVS
code should be modified and tested in a developement machine; then a new release
should be done generating a source distribution for it which can be installed
on the production machine (detailed instructions about how to upgrade the 
production machine installation can be found at [1]).

4.2. Web interface

The HTTP server...(ask Tibor how to deal with it).

The htdocs layer of the Indico system (mod_python handlers), resources and CSS 
stylesheets are installed under "/soft/httpd/host/indico/htdocs/". These files 
should be www-data readable.


5. Other

5.1. Submitted abstracts backup

For security reasons, all the submitted abstracts from the Call for Asbtarcts 
process are backed up in separated XML files. These files are strored under the
directory "/data04/bk".
